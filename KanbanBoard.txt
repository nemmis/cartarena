What provides the most value and could get feedback as early as possible ?

- player movement controlled with a gamepad (joystick)
- collisions, behaviour needs to be defined ? introduce an arena object, a set of static squares
- be able to fire bullets, reflection
- be able to shoot static targets, this is the training mode, see if rebounds add something, see if it is possible to have skilled shooting

---

- introduce going backward
- see trajectory of the player
- how to make a game independent of the resolution ? (e.g TV)
- introduce static and dynamic friction (so it is easy to start) (maybe a state, stopped, forward, backward is necessary)
  or change the dynamic friction model globally ?

= Requirements

Player movement
Similar to a cart
Can go backward and forward
Can steer right and left
Driving must be very dynamic
Friction model so the cart stops when it does not accelerate anymore
